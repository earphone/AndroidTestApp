	This is the first app tutorial from the android developer website.
	I am mainly using it to experiment with features that I may or may
	not want inside of any future apps that I create.
	
	July 6, 2013:	Created a template for testing Parse User Login

	Second Test:	July 1, 2013
			Worked on retrieving Parse objects with queries
			Experimented with different types of getX commands 
				for basic query

	First Test:	databasing and working with Parse
			"parse.com"
