	This is the first app tutorial from the android developer website.
	I am mainly using it to experiment with features that I may or may
	not want inside of any future apps that I create.
	
	ToDo:		Keep user logged in
			Forgotten password
			Find a way to link users together
			Able to read a linked users words
	
	Sept 21, 2013:	Added DatePickerFragment and TimePickerFragment classes
				to show fragments of time and date picking
				when certain buttons are clicked
				Currently, they do not do anything when
				submitted.
			Added text into AddDate that are clickable that
				instantiate the time and date fragments
	August 25, 2013:Added AddDate activity but nothing inside yet
			Added a button in chooser that leads to addDate
				and a function for onClick
	
	August 9, 2013:	Added ChooseActivity that allows user to either
				add a new word or view all words
			ListActivity properly lists all user submitted
				words in the database
			Properly added "Chooser" option in ListActivity,
				MainActivity, DisplayMessageActivity that
				sends the user up to the ChooseActivity

	August 8, 2013:	Updated Parse library from 1.3.0 to 1.3.2
				This fixed the issue of ParseQueryAdapter
				not being imported.

	July 31, 2013:  Minor edits to ListActivity using ParseQueryAdapter
				but it is not importing.  Working on
				researching the cause.  May just be buggy
				Eclipse.	

	July 20, 2013:	Implemented exiting the app with the back button
				from the login screen
			Created a new class in Parse called "UserMessages"
				that contains all of the messages added
				by users and links it to them

	July 18, 2013:	Implemented Logout in the actionbar for Main and
				Display activities
			Logout clears ParseUser from phone cache and sends
				the user back to the Login activity
	
	July 17, 2013:	Made the icon clickable in MainActivity and
				DisplayMessageActivity and sends to Main

	July 10, 2013:	Finished login to handle correct and incorrect logins	
			Deleted keep logged in checkbox on loging screen for
				convenience and till further research is done
			Overrode the onBackPressed function for loginActivity
				to prevent going back after user logged out

	July 9, 2013:	Added a signup activity
			  Creates a new Parse user with the following
				fields:
					username
					name
					email
					password
			Linked the login activity to signup activity by button
			Linked the signup activity to main by buton
			Experimented with Toasts to show if signup was 
				successful or not

	July 7, 2013:	Added a login activity
			Modified the manifest so that the login activity is
				viewed when the app is launched	

	July 6, 2013:	Created a template for testing Parse User Login

	Second Test:	July 1, 2013
			Worked on retrieving Parse objects with queries
			Experimented with different types of getX commands 
				for basic query

	First Test:	databasing and working with Parse
			"parse.com"
