	This is the first app tutorial from the android developer website.
	I am mainly using it to experiment with features that I may or may
	not want inside of any future apps that I create.
	
	ToDo:		Keep user logged in
			Forgotten password
			Find a way to link users together
			Have a user submit a word
			Able to read a linked users words

	July 18, 2013:	Implemented Logout in the actionbar for Main and
				Display activities
			Logout clears ParseUser from phone cache and sends
				the user back to the Login activity
	
	July 17, 2013:	Made the icon clickable in MainActivity and
				DisplayMessageActivity and sends to Main

	July 10, 2013:	Finished login to handle correct and incorrect logins	
			Deleted keep logged in checkbox on loging screen for
				convenience and till further research is done
			Overrode the onBackPressed function for loginActivity
				to prevent going back after user logged out

	July 9, 2013:	Added a signup activity
			  Creates a new Parse user with the following
				fields:
					username
					name
					email
					password
			Linked the login activity to signup activity by button
			Linked the signup activity to main by buton
			Experimented with Toasts to show if signup was 
				successful or not

	July 7, 2013:	Added a login activity
			Modified the manifest so that the login activity is
				viewed when the app is launched	

	July 6, 2013:	Created a template for testing Parse User Login

	Second Test:	July 1, 2013
			Worked on retrieving Parse objects with queries
			Experimented with different types of getX commands 
				for basic query

	First Test:	databasing and working with Parse
			"parse.com"
